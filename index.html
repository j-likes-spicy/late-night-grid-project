            Getting better at CSS grid, one small project at a time. I added a
            few extra words here and there, just to give myself some content to
            work with.

          All in all, this was a really simple project. As you can see, it
          doesn't look very great, yet it does help me better understand how
          it's possible to utilize CSS Grid to make a perfectly responsive
          website, with zero media queries. Now that I've been able to see this
          for myself in action, I plan to use this more often for other
          projects. Thanks for reading, and feel free to use the code to your
          liking, for any reason. Special thanks to Unsplash and their
          photographers for making these graphics possible.
